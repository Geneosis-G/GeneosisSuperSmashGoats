[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Well, I thought the previous mod took a lot of time... I was wrong, this one was even worst XD Anyway I'm glad it's finally complete and I hope you'll have fun with it :)
The idea of this mod is a bit obvious, I simply tried to recreate the % mechanism of the SSB games. After making the Hero Goat, I had a good idea on how to display some information on the screen, and the RPGoat gave me an easy way to detect the damages taken by the goat... So all I had to do was to extend the damage detection and display to any creature :p
Then I had to implement the knockback effect. This was a bit tricky because the damage count is partially based on the acceleration of the goat, so when I tried to do it the first result was a knockback giving more % giving more knockback giving an infinite speed to the creature after only one hit XD After trying many possible solution I found one to fix that problem: basically I only apply the knockback effect once per acceleration, which means that as long as the goat is going faster it will not trigger the knockback effect, so no infinite loop.
At this point, I my first idea for this mod was done... But it felt like somthing was missing. What is a SSB game if you can't actually fight to throw your opponents out of the game? So I decided to create an arena system to allow players to fight in a restricted area :)
Nothing special to say about this part :p Detecting which fighter pushed another one out of the arena was a bit tricky, but for the rest that's just counting points and displaying some information ^^
